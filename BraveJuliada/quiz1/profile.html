      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Brave Juliada. I am an undergraduate student in Informatics Engineering at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Indonesia, 
        currently in my third semester as of Q3 2025</p>
      <p>I enjoy game development, especially coding, and creating pixel art for them.
         Naturally, I also enjoy playing games. In my free time, I usually watch YouTube videos,
         listen to J-Pop, play games, or work on my game development project, which I hope to 
         release next year</p>
      <p>One of the reasons I chose Informatics Engineering as my bachelor's degree is my dream of creating games
        independently. I began my journey as a game developer in my first semester with Construct 3, which I highly
         recommend for beginners since it uses blueprints and visual coding, an excellent
          introduction to game development. Currently, I mainly use Godot for my projects and
           Aseprite for pixel art. I tried Unity at first, but after trying Godot,
            I found out that it's faster for 2D games and more pixel-art-friendly</p>
       <p>I also want to get into sound engineering, especially for creating game 
        soundtracks for my projects. However, I haven’t found the time for it yet, 
        or, more accurately, I’ve been a bit lazy.
